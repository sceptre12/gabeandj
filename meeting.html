                <h2>Gabriel's Version...</h2>
                <p>I strolled into a meeting held by the FIU National Society of Black Engineers dressed in my sharp black work uniform, freshly cut hair, and excited looking to join an organization at my local university. Yet I was cut short by a notepad and pen held by Janelle instructing me to sign-in and take a seat. Unlike my usual suave composure, I couldn't find the words to respond and just stared real real real ... real hard at her wavy hair, buttermilk skin, and wide cheezy smile. I couldn't find the words, nor did she give me a chance to recover because one second she was there the next she had already swooped off to attack someone else. I did stay for the meeting though, but I my thoughts were only of her and when would I finally get the chance to speak to her...</p>

                <h2>Janelle's Version...</h2>
                <p>During My junior year at FIU, I was the most enthusiastic treasurer The National Society of Black Engineers has ever had. During the first meeting of the semester, I was tasked with greeting our prospective members and getting their information on the sign-in sheet. I saw Gabriel enter the room and I ran over to him and gave him the clip board. My mind was running a thousand miles a second, wondering "where have I seen this boy before...hmmm he's kinda cute...what a charming smile...eww he's wearing flip flops and his toes are a mess...OH! Another person at the door!"</p>
