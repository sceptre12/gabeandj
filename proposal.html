                <h2>When It Happened:</h2>
                <p>Thursday, March 13, 2014</p>
                <h2>How we got engaged</h2>
                <p>If there is one thing we love, that is the comfort and bliss of being near open water. Whether it be a warm pool, cozy lake, or a beautiful blue beach, we rather be there than anywhere else. It was inevitable that we would start a new chapter in our love on the waters of Miami Beach.</p>
                <p>The stage was set as a simple birthday gift for two. Where? She would not know until the last minute. We met after work and drove to the docks, where an illustrious 47’ yacht with its captain and cook awaited to serve just the two of us. Before we knew it, we were gliding along the coast of Miami, sipping on sweet wine, snacking on sharp cheddar cheese with fruit, and laughing endlessly hearing stories with the crew.</p>
                <p>After a little bit, the captain eased us into an exclusive bay and announced that dinner would be ready in a few. Into the water we dived. Calm, cool, and pristine the bay was perfect for the beautiful day. It was then I shared with her that I had spent the entire past year learning how to swim just for this “birthday gift.” Time passed too fast because before we knew it dinner was ready… and my heart started racing.</p>
                <p>Climbing back onto the boat, I made eye contact with the crew and nodded. With James Bond like skills, the captain snuck the precious black box that we had hidden in the cabin to me and invited us to take pictures near the bow of the yacht to capture the sunset. As we posed, smiled, and chuckled, I turned to her and confessed, “…this date is not only for your birthday; (dropping to my knees) I wanted to let you know that I love you &amp; want to share the rest of my life with you will you marry me ?”</p>
